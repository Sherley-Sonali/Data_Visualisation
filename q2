What is the age distribution of participants, and does it correlate with 
performance? 
Suggested Visualization: Heatmap (A Scatter Plot)
• Details: The heatmap will have events on the x-axis, with each column 
representing a specific event, and age groups on the y-axis, divided into 
consistent intervals (e.g., 10–20, 21–30, etc.). The colour gradient will represent 
the performance metric, with lighter colours indicating lower performance and 
darker or more saturated colours showing higher performance levels. 
 Purpose: Offers insights into age-based preferences and performance trends, 
helping tailor events to participant demographics.
